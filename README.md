# Prog2B-Summer-2022-CSS430-Operating-System

This assignment is focusing on implementing the scheduler for the kernel to decide which process or task to be run first. There are three different schedulers algorithm to be used, such as multilevel feedback queue (scheduler_mfq.java), round robin(scheduler_rr.java) and priority queue algorithm (scheduler_pri.java).

# Before running the program
Type "javac -deprecation Scheduler.java"

# To run

In console or IDE terminal,

1. Locate the file directory
2. copy each scheduler algorithm to the scheduler.java file by using "cp Scheduler_pri.java Scheduler.java" or "cp Scheduler_mfq.java Scheduler.java" or "cp Scheduler_rr.java Scheduler.java" to copy priority queue, multilevel feedback queue, and round robin algorithm to Scheduler.java respectively.
3. type "javac *.java" to compile all .java file
4. Type "java boot"
5. Then "l Test2b" or "l Test2"
6. When done, type "q"
